# Dotfiles

This repository contains the configuration files (dotfiles) for various applications and tools that I use on my system. These dotfiles are managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), a symlink farm manager.

### Yabai Installation

One of the packages listed in the Brewfile is yabai, a tiling window manager. However, yabai requires additional installation steps. To install yabai from the HEAD, please follow the instructions in the [this guide](<https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Installing-yabai-(from-HEAD)>).
